## Sublime Text Launcher

### Introduction
This (very) small utility provides the means to replace Notepad.exe on Windows with Sublime.

More information about Sublime can be found on [the Sublime website](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

### Installation

Installation is simple:

* Download the ZIP file from the [Downloads](https://github.com/downloads/grumpydev/Sublime-Notepad-Replacement/SublimeLauncher.zip) section. 
* Extract the ZIP to a temporary folder then copy both of the files from (SublimeLauncher.exe and ReplaceNotepad.bat) it into the same directory as Sublime itself.
* Run ReplaceNotepad.bat. You will need to "Run as Administrator" if using Vista/Win7.

Now when the system wants to launch Notepad it will launch Sublime instead.

Enjoy!
